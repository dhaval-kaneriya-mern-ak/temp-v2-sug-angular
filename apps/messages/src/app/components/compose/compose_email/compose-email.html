    your sign up page by email and get the participation flowing!

  <h4>
    Will SignUpGenius send out one email to everyone or individual emails?
  </h4>
  <p>
    We'll send out individual emails to each of your invitees. Your invitees
    will not know the email addresses of anyone else you invite. You'll be able
    to confirm that each email was delivered in the "Sent" tab of our Messages
    area.
  </p>
  <h4>Do I need to include a link to my sign up in the message I write?</h4>
  <p>
    Nope. We make it easy and include that link for you in the email right
    underneath the message that you compose. To select which sign up the email
    <span>DID YOU KNOW...</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    SignUpGenius Pro customers can send one email to invite users to multiple
    sign ups at once or invite them to a group of tabbed sign ups. Learn more
    about SignUpGenius Pro <a href="">here.</a>
  </p>
  <h4>Who will the email come from?</h4>
  <p>
    For basic users, when an invitee receives your email, the "from" name in
    your invitee's email program will show the name that is on your account as
    the sign up creator. To ensure we comply with spam regulations, the email
    will come from info@signupgenius.com, but if a user replies to the message,
    the reply will go to your email address.
  </p>
  <span>DID YOU KNOW...</span>
  <p>
    SignUpGenius Pro customers have the ability to customize the "from" name
    (useful if you are writing on behalf of an organization) and can have
    replies directed to multiple account admins. To set up your account admins,
    visit the "Pro Tools" area of your account page. Learn more about
    SignUpGenius Pro <a href="">here.</a>
  </p>
  <h4>How do I select the people I want to invite?</h4>
  <p>
    We provide lots of options so you can invite as many or as few people as
    you'd like. If you haven't worked with SignUpGenius previously, you can
    manually enter emails or import a list of emails from a variety of popular
    formats. If you've used SignUpGenius before, you can select an existing
    group of users to send out your invites. Emails that you enter manually or
    import will automatically be added to the group associated with your sign up
    so that you can use the list again in the future.
  </p>
  <span>DID YOU KNOW...</span>
  <p>
    SignUpGenius Pro customers can send messages and invites to multiple email
    groups at once and can include attachments in their emails. Learn more about
    SignUpGenius Pro <a href="">here.</a>
